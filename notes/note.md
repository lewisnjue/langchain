to compare embeddings, we geneearlly use similarity metrics that measure the closeness of two vectors ( embeddings ) in a high demensianal space. two of the most common metrics for this are cosine similarity and eucliean distance. 


## cosine similarity 

cosine similarity measures the angle between tow vectors. it does not consider the magnitude ( lenght ) of the vectors, only thir direction, which make it particularyly useful for high dimensianl data like work embeddings , where were interested in the directoon of a concept rather than its size. the cosine of the angle between tow vectors ranges from -1 to 1. 

- 1. vectors are exactly teh same directorn ( maximm similarity )
- 0 : vectors are orthogonal ( non similaryity )
- -1 : vetors are in opposite directors ( complete dissimilarity )

the formula is : 

cosine similaty = (A . B) / (||A|| ||B||)

where : 
A . B is the dot product of vectors A and B . 

||A|| and || B|| are the magnutite 

in practice , teh cosine similarity is calcuated by dividing the ot product by the proect of magunuted of hte cectors . 


interpretation 

cosine similarty is weidly used for comparing embeddings , especially for the text dat and serch engines , because it captues whether two vectors point in the same directooion regardless of their length . 


## euclidean distance 


eucliean distance is another way to measure the similarity or distance between two embeddings , by calculating the sstraight lien ( or euclidean ) distance between them. 
unlike cosine similaryt , euclidean distance taeks the magnitued of the vectors inoto account 

formula 
given two vectors A and B with componensts ( a1,a2,...) and ( b1,b2 ...) 

EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE = squareroot ( sum from i = 1 to n ( a1 - b1)^2)


this formula computes the squre root of the sum of the squred differenes between corresponding components of the vectors . 

interpretain 

- smaller valeus : indicates that the two vectors are closer to each other and therefore more similar . 

- large valeus indicates grater distance or dissimilairyt 

euclidean distance canbe very effective for embeddisng in ow dimenstainal spaces where the magnitued matters . however , i high dimenstal spaces , it can become less informeative ecause teh istances tend to become more uniform , so consine similary tsi generally preferred in tehse cases. 

## summary : cosine similaryt vs euclidean distance 


- consine similarity  is usually prefereed when hte direction is more important than the magnitude. 

- eulidean distance is often used when both direction adn magnutude matter asnd is especially common in clustering task like k-means 


in most modern embeddingscomparieson , consine similarity is the go to metric due to its ability to handle high dimenenstal space effectively . 

### note 

in teh context of embeddings , high dimensinal and low dimenstial refer to the number of features ( or components that make up a vector) 

## low dimensial space 

- lwo dimental vectors ahve relatively few components ( featues ) 
- example include 2D and 3 D spaces , wehre a vecotr has only 2 or 3 number of its components . 
- in these spaces , it easy to visulaize the dat points and relationshps between them as we can plot 2d or 3d points on a graph . 

- for instace if we represent a point in 2D , it might be somethign like ( 3, 4) in 3D it might be ( 3, 4 , 5) 



## hig dimenstal space 

- high dimensional : vecots have many components , often hundres or thousands . 

- for example , word embeddigns like word2vec or bert might represesnt works with vecors that have 100 , 300 or even 768 dimenstals . 


- high dimenstinal dat is difficult to visulaize and interpret directly as humsn are limited to visualizing three dimenstails 

- for instance a vector in 300 dimenstal space mgiht look like [ 2.3,-1.4,0.5....,1.7] with 300 number in total 

## why dimensionality matters 

- low dimenstal spaces are straight forward adn efficent to work with but they may not cpture as much information or complexity . 

- high dimenstal spaces can represent much more complex relationships , whcih is especially useful for representing comcpet , image or documents, however , they requrie more computational resource and distances between pooints can become less inforamative ( a phenomenon called the curse ofdimenstality )


in embeddigns , high dimensal spaces are common because they allow us to represent more nauced relatioships beteen concepts , however if thes embeddigns are too large , techniues like dimenstality reducion can reduce the dimenstals to meke teh dat esiler to work with whle preversing the most important information
